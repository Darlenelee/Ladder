# Ladder 
Hw1 for SE417
<p>A Java implementation of Lab3 WordLadder in SE117
<p>
<p>There are two versions of the program:
<li>1. [file] Ladder.java: The directed translation from C++; no OO; no Gradle ; no testing 
<li>2. [directory] wordladder/: The upgraded version; with three methods inside the class; built and tested by Gradle and Junit
<li><b>Caution: when using the second one, remember to type in "../dictionary.txt" instead of "dictionary.txt" to read in words
